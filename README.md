This repository contains the [Code of Conduct for the Italian C++ Community Events](code_of_conduct.md). 
The Code of Conduct is a set of rules regarding appropriate behavior at Italian C++ events and procedures for dealing with violations of those rules. It is a derivative of the [C++ Code of Conduct](https://github.com/brycelelbach/cpp_code_of_conduct), which is itself a derivative of the [PyCon Code of Conduct](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct).

Together with the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md), follow these informal rules to maximize your experience at Italian C++ events:

1. **Go on a Learning Safari**: Everyone has something to teach. Everyone has something to learn. Take an intellectual, spiritual, and creative journey.
2. **Be professional**: Embrace diversity, be polite, so that everyone can enjoy the conference.
3. **Build Friendships**: Italian C++ events are not just about networking, they are also about building lifelong friends. The people attending are amazing. Get to know them.
4. **Have Fun**: If it's not fun, doesn't count.
